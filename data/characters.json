            "description": "Freddy Fazbear is the titular main antagonist of Five Nights at Freddy's, who acts as the mascot of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. While acting as the beloved mascot during the day, the possessed animatronic hunts down any adult in the establishment at night.",
            "behaviour": "Freddy Fazbear serves as the primary antagonist of the game. His role is to portray the main character's adversary and contribute to the custom night feature and to open up the map. Freddy Fazbear becomes active on Night 3 and continues to move throughout subsequent nights. He initially starts at the Show Stage and then progresses to the Dining Area, Bathroom, Kitchen, and eventually reaches the Office. If the player runs out of power, Freddy will also appear, and play his theme, the Toreador March, before game over. While he is visible on most cameras, only his eyes can be seen. It is crucial to keep an eye on him as his laughter indicates his movements and location. When he reaches the East Hall Corner, the player must either monitor Cam 4B or close the right door to prevent him from entering the office. Allowing Freddy to enter the office results in a game over. Additionally, a tactic known as 'cam-locking' can be employed when Freddy is on the Show Stage or in the East Hall Corner. This involves observing him on the camera without switching to another room, which effectively immobilizes Freddy in that location. This strategy can be useful for completing the 20/20/20/20 mode while conserving power. However, cam-locking on the Show Stage does not work in the 20/20/20/20 mode. A number between 1 and 20 is chosen at random, which is compared to Freddyâ€™s current AI level. If the level is more or equal to the number, Freddy will move. He gets an opportunity to progress every 3.02 seconds.",

It is not decodable because of how distorted the sound is. \nWhen the player retracts the Monitor, Phantom Mangle will rise up behind the window and remain there. After a few seconds, it will drop down from below the window, thus ending the hallucination and triggering an audio error. If the player does not switch cameras after a certain period of time as passed, Phantom Mangle can, and will, force the Monitor down.",

If the player views the Phantom Puppet in CAM 08, they are advised to immediately change the monitor's view. If this warning is not exercised, the Phantom Puppet will teleport to The Office and closely stare directly into the player's face, causing a ventilation error and blocking the use of both the Maintenance Panel and the monitor. \nOnce in the room, the Phantom Puppet cannot be warded off and must leave on his own, which will take approximately 17 seconds. During this period, he allows time for Springtrap to move closer to the player while also leaving the player vulnerable to the other phantoms, especially Phantom Freddy, who may attack, even while the Phantom Puppet is still in The Office.",
