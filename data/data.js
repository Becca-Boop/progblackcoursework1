            "description": "Freddy Fazbear is the titular main antagonist of Five Nights at Freddy's, who acts as the mascot of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. While acting as the beloved mascot during the day, the possessed animatronic hunts down any adult in the establishment at night.",
            "behaviour": "Freddy Fazbear serves as the primary antagonist of the game. His role is to portray the main character's adversary and contribute to the custom night feature and to open up the map. Freddy Fazbear becomes active on Night 3 and continues to move throughout subsequent nights. He initially starts at the Show Stage and then progresses to the Dining Area, Bathroom, Kitchen, and eventually reaches the Office. If the player runs out of power, Freddy will also appear, and play his theme, the Toreador March, before game over. While he is visible on most cameras, only his eyes can be seen. It is crucial to keep an eye on him as his laughter indicates his movements and location. When he reaches the East Hall Corner, the player must either monitor Cam 4B or close the right door to prevent him from entering the office. Allowing Freddy to enter the office results in a game over. Additionally, a tactic known as 'cam-locking' can be employed when Freddy is on the Show Stage or in the East Hall Corner. This involves observing him on the camera without switching to another room, which effectively immobilizes Freddy in that location. This strategy can be useful for completing the 20/20/20/20 mode while conserving power. However, cam-locking on the Show Stage does not work in the 20/20/20/20 mode. A number between 1 and 20 is chosen at random, which is compared to Freddyâ€™s current AI level. If the level is more or equal to the number, Freddy will move. He gets an opportunity to progress every 3.02 seconds."
